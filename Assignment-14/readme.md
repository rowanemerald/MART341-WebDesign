My user tests went well. I made sure to ask them questions about certain things; and because parents have a habit of just saying whatever their child makes is 'perfect', I made sure to pressure them on the question if they would change anything. 

I actually did change some things. I made the Home button more obvious as a button and what it does. Previously it had just been a small picture of a moth in the corner. I also changed where the text captions for my pictures were and made my videos into gifs.

I'm still having trouble making my website at least usable on smaller screens. Some things were just too big while others, on the same page even, were just perfect.  I had to recruit my mom (who codes, though not in css) to help; and figured out some other sizing features myself. It's better, but I wouldn't consider it perfect.
