What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?
A directory is a folder that contains and organizes files.
How are VCS useful?
VCs can record anything done to a file and can make big changes to a file. It can be shared and other people can see and edit the files.
Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite?
I like painting, acrylic specifically. I like the feel of the paint brush under my hand and seeing the finished product.
