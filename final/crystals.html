                        My crystal carvings are 1 to 2 inches each.
                        <br/>
                        They are each made with a different kind of gemstone.
                        <br/>
                        All carved (supposedly) by hand with different size tiny dremels.

                    Toothess from How to Train Your Dragon! It was advertised as being made of fluorite, 
                    <br/>
                    HOWEVER, I recently found bubbles in it; and that means it's fake unfortunately... 
                    <br/>
                    It was $7, you get what you pay for!

                        This fox is a conundrum. The seller discription said both quartz and white jade; 
                        <br/>
                       and obviously it can't be both those things.
                       <br/>
                        It's a consistent white like a jade would be, but it's got some sparkle like a quartz might.
                        <br/>
                        Then maybe glass? But it shows signs of being a real stone; like being heavy and cold.
                        <br/>
                        So who knows!

<p>
    Here's one of my favorites!
    <br/>
    It a moon carved from aura citrine.
    <br/> It's a complicated process to make something "aura". 
    <br/>
     A quartz crystal (which includes amethyst and citrine) is heat treated with a metal vapor, 
      <br/>
     like silver,
    
      using a vacuum chamber to make it show different colors from certain angles!

</div>

<img src="images/wolf-gem.jpg" width="600" alt="dark gray gem carved to look like a howling wolf"/>

<br/>



<p>
    This wolf is made from labradorite! 
    <br/>
    Not in this one, but in other types of larbradorite, there is what's called a "flash".
    <br/>
    A flash is a part of the stone that is shiny and iridescent with different colors!
    <br/>
    Kind of like aura!
