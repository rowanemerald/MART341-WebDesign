                    How To Train Your Dragon is by far my biggest collection.
                    <br/>
                    I have been accumulating merch and collector's items for almost 10 years now.
                    <br/>
                    At this point this collection is worth hundreds of dollars as things have increased in price.
                    <br/>
                    And I still wouldn't consider this collection complete!

                    How To Train Your Dragon has even made it's way into my love of painting.
                    <br/>
                    With tiny brushes I have made these figures detailed and more true to the movies.
                    <br/>
                    I have also fixed a poster that got paint on it and turned it into true art!
